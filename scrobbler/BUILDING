This package requires the Cupcake SDK.

The new SDK creates a folder for autogenerated files named gen/

In order to build, you will need to open the gen/ folder in eclipse, right click and pick
new -> java package, and create a "com.android.music" package in order for your workspace
to build.  If you do a clean build, you will need to repeat this process.

To build the scrobbler, you must symblink in the library:

cd scrobbler/src/fm/last
ln -s ../../../../library/src/fm/last/api api
ln -s ../../../../library/src/fm/last/util util
ln -s ../../../../library/src/fm/last/xml xml
ln -s ../../../../../app/src/fm/last/android/utils android/utils

You must also create a PrivateAPIKey.java in scrobbler/src/fm/last/android/scrobbler.
See README.API_KEY for details.
