	<title>Introduction</title>
	<para>Welcome to <application>&app;</application>
	! Last.fm is a music service that lets
	you discover new music you like,
	based on the music you already listen
	to.</para>

	<para>Last.fm is filled with tons of information on artists, albums and tracks
	including charts, statistics and more, all built by the Last.fm users
	who’re keeping track of what they’re listening to with Last.fm. This
	process is called 'Scrobbling,' and can be enabled or disabled from the
	Settings screen.</para>

	<para>You can read more about artists you like, view similar artists, see
	upcoming concerts, and explore interesting genres using this app. If
	you're not sure how to do something or get lost, press the Menu button
	on your device and tap 'Help' to access this guide again at a later
	time.</para>
